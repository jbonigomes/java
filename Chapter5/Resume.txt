Chapter 5

Create arrays of primitive types

	- Declare an array variable
	- Allocate memory to store the element

	int[] someArray;
	someArray = new int[10];

	or

	double[] temperature = new double[7];

	or

	double[] temperature = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

	or

	temperature[0] = 1;

Use loops to process arrays

	When creating loops to process arrays, a built-in function .length is quite useful

Use an enhanced for loop to process an array

	for(double item : temperature)
	{
		System.out.println(item);
	}

Use arrays as method inputs and outputs

	Simply pass the variable name, no need for square brackets
	Remember that arrays are objects and so are passed by reference, meaning that if you pass an array to a method and you change it, you are changing the actual array
