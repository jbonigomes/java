Chapter 7

Objectives:

	Design classes using the notation of the Unified Modeling Language (UML)
	Write the Java code for a specified class
	Explain the difference between public and private access to attributes and methods

		on a class variable, private means it can only be accessed within the class and public by any other class
		likewise, for methods, the same rule applies.
		We generally declare methods as public, unless they are the class helper methods and variables are almost always declared as private

	Explain the use of the static keyword

		When used on a class variable, it means that the variable is a class variable, changing it will change all objects too
		When used on a method, it means that the method can then be accessed without the need to instanciate the class

	Pass objects as parameters
	Implement collection classes based on arrays
