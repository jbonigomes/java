Chapter 3

Explain the term iteration

	Iteration is the form of program control that allows us to instuct the computer to carry out a task over and over again by repeating a section of code

Explain the term input validation and write simple validation routines

	Input validation is the art of sanity checking external input into a given program.
	This process aims to ensure that no malicious or errouneous entries get absorbed by the code

public class Hello {
		public static void main(String[] args) {
			
			// Repeat a section of code with a for loop
			for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
			{
				// this is best used when we know how many times we will have to iterate
			}

			// Repeat a section of code with a while loop
			while(/* some condition is true */)
			{
				// this is best used when we don't know how many times we will iterate
			}

			// Repeat a section of code with a do...while loop
			do
			{
				// this is best used when we don't know how many times we will iterate but we know we want to iterate at least once
			} while(/* something is true */);
		}
