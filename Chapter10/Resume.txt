Chapter 10

Objectives
	Identify and use some of the common components of the Java Swing package
	Program graphics components to handle mouse-click events
	Describe the role of layout managers
	Use the FlowLayout and BorderLayout managers
	Make use of compound containers

To exit a program at any point use:

	System.exit(0);

To exit when using JFrame and the user preses the close arrow:

	setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);

This is a very dense subject, please refer to the code examples for more details

One interesting point raised here though, when converting a String to Double, we can use the wrapper Double class, likewise, we could use the Integer helper class if we want to parse it to int:

	String str = "34.00";
	Double d = Double.parseDouble(str);
	
The last thing is watch out for the import statements when building GUI's

The Programming exercises for this chapter are still outstanding
