Chapter 4

Explain the meaning of the term method

	A method is a function within a class that will perform and action, this action is simply an encapsulated piece of code

Declare and define methods
	
	The main method is for example the entry point method for any given Java program

Call a method

	Simply type in the method's name followed by (), if the method accepts parameters then they must be written within the brackets, multiple parameters should be separated by a comma

Explain the meaning of the terms actual parameters and formal parameters

	Actual parameters are the actual values we send to a method:
		price = addTax(price, tax);
	Formal parameters are the parameters declared int the signature of a method and are awaiting for values to be passed in
		public void addTax(double price, double tax)

Identify the scope of a particular variable

	The scope of a value dictates where the value can be used, for example if int i was declared inside a loop, it is then not accesible outside the loop

Explain the meaning of the term polymorphism

	Polymorphism is the techinic used to send the same message but have have different behavious depending on the situation, method overloading is a good example of polymorphism, where two methods have the same name but accept different parameters
