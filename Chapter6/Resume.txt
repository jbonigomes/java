Chapter 6

Explain the meaning of the term object-oriented

	Object oriented programming consists of defining one or more classes that interact with each other in order to modularize a complex program promoting code reuse, polymorphism, encapsulation and so on...

Explain the concept of encapsulation

	Encapusulation or information hidding is the ability object oriented software development approaches give us in order to deny direct access to data from another class

Explain the terms class and object

	A class is the blue print of an object, an object is an instance of a class.

Create objects in Java

	Must be done using the new keyword:
		Oblong myOblong = new Oblong(length, height);

Call the methods of an object

	Must be done with a . then the name of the method:
		String str = new String("Hello");
		str.length();

Create and use arrays of objects

	Very handy when creating a collection of objects in a class;
		Oblong[] myOblongArray = new Oblong[3];

A constructor is a special method, with the same name as the class it belongs to, it's principle is to allow some action to happen when and object is instanciated from a given class. I.E. when the new keyword is called. A construct is not mandatory in Java, Java will use a "default construct" if a given class was not provided with one.

When calling a method from one class from another class, the method must be static and the other class must be available to the compiler

Please remember that an array of objects sets up an array of referencess
